That same person may burn up to 715 calories an hour swimming at a more vigorous pace. A 200-pound person doing the same activities would burn between 528 and 892 calories an hour. A 240-pound person might burn between 632 and 1,068.",

The motions of running, jumping and rapid lateral cuts all can deliver the player a great deal of exercise where calories can be burnt. Although having calories is not necessarily bad for you, having too much and not burning enough can lead to weight gain and consequently, other health problems.",

The constant walking, jogging and running help keep the playerâ€™s heart rate up, providing an excellent cardiovascular exercise. This constant movement helps players strengthen their hearts, resist plaque build-up in the coronary arteries, reduce their blood pressure and burn excess calories.",
